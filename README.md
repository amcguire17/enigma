## Enigma Self Evaluation

### Functionality

For functionality I would say that I met expectations. The command line interface runs successfully and the methods encrypt and decrypt methods.

### Object Oriented Programming

For OOP I would say I meet expectations or may be above expectations. I feel that the way I placed my methods makes sense and added a few modules in to DRY up my code.

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics

For Ruby Conventiosn and Mechanics I would say I meet expectations. I believe I chose the right data structures/enumerables to complete the project and have mostly proper spacing and line formatting. 

### Test Driven Development

For TDD I would say I meet expectations. Coverage is 100% and tests were mostly written before code. I also feel that edge cases were accounted for in testing.
